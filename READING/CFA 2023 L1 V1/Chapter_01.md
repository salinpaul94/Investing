## THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY

### LEARNING OUTCOMES

**The reader should be able to:-**

- Interpret interest rates as required rates of return, discount rates, or opportunity costs.
- Explain an interest rate as the sum of a real risk-free rate and premiums that compensate investors for bearing distinct types of risk.
- Calculate and interpret the future value **(FV)** and present value **(PV)** of a single sum of money, an ordinary annuity, an annuity due, a perpetuity (PV only), and a series of unequal cash flows.
- Demonstrate the use of a time line in modeling and solving time value of money problems.
- Calculate the solution for time value of money problems with different frequencies of compounding.
- Calculate and interpret the effective annual rate, given the stated annual interest rate and the frequency of compounding.

### INTRODUCTION

- As individuals, we often face decisions that involve saving money for a future use, or borrowing money for current consumption.
- We then need to determine the amount we need to invest, if we are saving, or the cost of borrowing.
- As investment analysts, much of work also involves evaluating transactions with present and future cash flows.
- When we place a value on any security, for example, we are attempting to determine the worth of stream of future cash flows.
- **To carry out all the above tasks accurately, we must understand the mathematics of time value of money problems.**
- _Money has time value in that individuals value a given amount of money more highly the earlier it is received._
- > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Therefor, a smaller amount of money now may be equivalent in value to a large amount received at a future date.
- > [!NOTE]
  > The **time value of money** as a topic in investment mathematics deals with equivalence relationships between cash flows with different dates.
- **Mastery of time value of money concepts and techniques is essential for investment analysis.**

### INTEREST RATES

- [ ] Interpret interest rates as required rates of return, discount rates, or opportunity costs
- [ ] Explain an interest rate as the sum of a real risk-free rate and premiums that compensate investors for bearing distinct types of risk

In this section a brief explanation of the meaning and interpretation of interest rates is covered.

- Time value of money concerns equivalence relationships between cash flows occurring on different dates.
- The idea of equivalence relationships is relatively simple.
  - Consider the following exchange:
  - You pay \$10,000 today and in return receive \$9,500 today.
    - Would accept this arrangement? **Not Likely**.
  - But what if you received the \$9,500 today and paid the \$10,000 one year from now?
  - Can these amounts be considered equivalent?
