### INTRODUCTION

- As individuals, we often face decisions that involve saving money for a future use, or borrowing money for current consumption.
- We then need to determine the amount we need to invest, if we are saving, or the cost of borrowing.
- As investment analysts, much of work also involves evaluating transactions with present and future cash flows.
