## THE FUNCTIONS OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM

> - Explain the main functions of the financial system

- The financial system includes markets and various financial intermediaries that help transfer :-
  - financial assets
  - real assets
  - financial risks
- in various form :-

  - from one entity to another
  - from one place to another
  - from one point in time to another

- These transfers take place whenever someone exchanges

  - one asset or financial contract for another.

- The assets and contracts that people trade include :-
  - notes
  - bonds
  - stocks
  - exchange-traded funds
  - currencies
  - forward contracts
  - futures contracts
  - option contracts
  - swap contracts
  - certain commodities

> When the buyer and seller voluntarily arrange their trades, as is usually the case, the buyer and the seller both expect to be better off.

People use the financial system for six main purposes :-

1. To save money for the future.
2. To borrow money for current use.
3. To raise equity capital.
4. To manage risks.
5. To exchange assets for immediate and future deliveries.
6. To trade on information.

The main functions of the financial system are to facilitate :-

1. The achievement of the purpose for which people use the financial system.
2. The discovery of the rates of return that equate aggregate savings with aggregate borrowings and
3. The allocation of capital to the best uses.

### HELPING PEOPLE ACHIEVE THEIR PURPOSES IN USING THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM

#### Saving

- People often have money that they choose not to spend now and that they want available in future.
- To move money from the present to the future savers buy

  - notes
  - certificates of deposit
  - bonds
  - stocks
  - mutual funds
  - real assets such as real estate

- These alternatives generally provide a better rate of return than simply storing money.
- Savers then sell these assets in the future to fund their future expenditures.
- **When savers commit money to earn a financial return, they commonly are called investors.**
- _They invest when they purchase assets, and they divest when they sell them._
  <br><br>
- Investors require a fair rate of return while their money is invested.
- The required fair rate of return compensates them for the use of money and for the risk that they may lose money if the investment fails or if inflation reduces the real value of their investments.
- The financial system facilitates savings when institutions create investment vehicles, such as :-
  - bank deposits
  - notes
  - stocks
  - mutual funds
    <br>
    that investors can acquire and sell without paying substantial transaction costs.
    <br>
    **When these instruments are fairly priced and easy to trade, investors will use them to save more.**
